# jupyterlab_practice

This repository hosts two example jupyter notebook files that showcase some of the functionalities of jupyter notebooks. These two notebooks are located within the `notebooks` folder.
- `question11.ipynb` contains a code cell with a function and a markdown cell containing a mathematical equation formatted using $\LaTeX$ (LaTeX).
- `question12.ipynb` contains a markdown cell with a python code block and two code cells that execute terminal commands. One of these terminal commands exports the notebook to HTML. This `question12.html` file can be found in the `notebooks/exports/` directory.
